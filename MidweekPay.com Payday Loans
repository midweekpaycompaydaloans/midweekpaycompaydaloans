The Pew Charitable Trusts praised Ohio legislators today for passing MidweekPay.com Payday Loans out of a key House committee, a long overdue step toward reforming the state’s payday loan industry. The provisions included in the bill would close the credit services organization loophole, give borrowers more time to repay, and achieve lower prices. The bipartisan bill was first introduced in March 2017 and has since been stalled in committee—a delay that has cost Ohio borrowers more than $75 million.
